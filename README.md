# Problem Statement
I decided to embark on this assignment as a way of improving the medical system in my homeland, as we have far too many people dying from mild sicknesses such as (Asthma and Hypertension just to name a few). After careful analysis of the situation ,I realized that due to the overcrowding of our hospitals as well as a  lack of available health care professionals/ doctors patients who present with severe symptoms end up dying before even being examined by a doctor .It is my hopes that with the design of a prediction model software which records patient symptoms and make predictions as to the ailment which they might be suffering from ,As well as a weight system which would determine whether the patient should go directly to a doctor or if it is that the patient symptoms would only require them to  be seen by a nurse or a physician practitioner more lives will be saved . The proposed software would help   triage staff members to make a better assessment as to which patients should see the doctor immediately or which patient symptoms arenâ€™t as severe hence, they can be treated by a nurse. This will result in many lives  being saved as  doctors will now be able to better care for the patients whom are severely ill .
